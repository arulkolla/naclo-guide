Describing Computational Problems The main thing that unifies all computational problems on the NACLO is that they often (but not always) involve the use of algorithms and computer programming to solve linguistic puzzles. These problems require the use of computational thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as an understanding of linguistics and language structure. Many times, they start off with English and then expect you to either describe an algorithm or apply it to more English or other languages. There are several common types of computational aspects that may appear on the NACLO, including: Morphological analysis : Given a word or set of words, identify how to break them into morphological components (prefixes, suffixes, stems, etc.). Phonological analysis : Given a word or set of words, identify how to break them into phonological components (syllables, phonemes, etc.). Word sense disambiguation : Given a word that has multiple meanings, ientify how to determine which meaning is being used in a given context. Machine translation : A combination of all of the above. Machine categorization : Interpret how computers categorize and interpret classes of words. Human categorization : Interpret how humans categorize and interpret classes of words. Essentially, anything that involves languages, computers, and humans in some way is fair game, so the above list is very much not comprehensive. These problems are the most \"unpredictable\" in terms of what might come up in the future, but there are still a few things you can try to prepare for them. \"No Intro\" Problems Many (but not all) computational problems fall into one of two types: in one type, you aren't explained what the process or algorithm you are trying to look for is , and the majority of the problem is about finding this algorithm. The most important thing to remember here is Occam's razor : the simplest explanation is probably the correct one. It's important to start by breaking down the problem into smaller parts and identifying patterns or rules that might be involved. From there, you can start to develop hypotheses and test them out by applying them to different examples. It's also important to pay attention to any hints or clues that might be provided in the problem statement flavortext or in the examples given; often times, reading the opening blurb might provide an insight (or even very explicit hint!) into the phenomenon. \"With Intro\" Problems The other type of computational problem provides an introduction or explanation of the algorithm or process you are expected to use. In these cases, the challenge is often to apply the algorithm or process correctly to a new set of examples, and then see how it changes with minor changes to the input. You may be even asked to develop a new algorithm. The key to solving these problems is to fully understand the algorithm or process being described and to practice applying it to different examples. You may also need to adjust the algorithm or process to fit the specific requirements of the problem at hand. These problems are often much more CS-minded, so it might helpt to do a little bit of computational thinking here. General Tips Here are a few general summarized tips: Practice, practice, practice! The more you work with algorithms and programming, the more comfortable you will become with these types of problems. It might even help to do logic puzzles or something similar to get that logical part of your brain going. Use common sense. A lot of these problems involve \"general knowledge\" about how things interact and definitions of common words, so don't forget these when working through problems. Break the problem down into smaller parts and identify patterns or rules that might be involved. Pay attention to any hints or clues provided in the problem statement or examples given. Use Occam's razor: the simplest explanation is often the correct one. Fully understand the algorithm or process being described before attempting to apply it to new examples. Adjust the algorithm or process to fit the specific requirements of the problem at hand. Computational problems are also often very long, so it's important to consider how that factors into the time spent. Although they are often easier to make progress in than linguistics problems (because most of the knowledge is already known), they might take longer. Regardless, they are more reliable to get points than linguistics problems, so it's important to consider how you want to approach them. Practice Problems There aren't any walkthroughs in this section, since most computational problems are just \"working through them\" until you get to the answer. We recommend you time yourself, however, and see how much time it takes you to get to the idea in each of these problems, since the best way to get faster at these problems is through practice.

The parallel text serves as a key to unlock the meaning of the unknown language. The name \"Rosetta Stone\" comes from the famous ancient Egyptian artifact that was inscribed with a decree in three different scripts: hieroglyphics, Demotic script, and Ancient Greek. The discovery of the Rosetta Stone allowed scholars to decipher ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics by comparing them to the known Greek text. Rosettas are the bread and butter of linguistics olympiads; you can almost guarantee that you will see at least one on any olympiad you do. Despite this, they can often be very challenging, mainly because they can focus on so many aspects at once that you need to be careful to dissect. Often times, parts of phonology creep into these problems too, so you have to watch out for that! Morphology Morphology is like building with blocks to make words. Just like how you can make different things with Lego blocks, you can make different words by combining smaller parts called \"morphemes.\" Morphemes are like the Lego blocks - they're the building blocks of words. By putting different morphemes together, you can create different words and change their meaning. For example, the word \"unhappiness\" is made up of three morphemes: \"un-\", \"happy\", and \"-ness.\" The \"un-\" means not, \"happy\" means feeling good, and \"-ness\" means a state of. So when you put them all together, you get the word \"unhappiness\" which means not feeling good. In morphology Rosetta problems, you are given several words or phrases (but often not full sentences) in a target language and English, and you need to determine the rules for coming up with similar phrases. Noun Cases Source Resource Description Artifexian Nouns: A Case of Case A dive into several aspects of noun cases. (You definitely don't need to know everything discussed in this video!) When we talk about things, we sometimes need to use different words or word endings to show how they relate to the other words in a sentence. This is where noun cases come in. For example, let's say we have the sentence \"The cat chased the mouse.\" In this sentence, \"cat\" is the subject - it's doing the chasing - so we use the \"nominative\" case for the word \"cat.\" But if we change the sentence to \"The mouse was chased by the cat,\" now \"mouse\" is the subject and \"cat\" is the one doing the chasing. So now we use the \"nominative\" case for \"mouse\" and the \"accusative\" case for \"cat.\" To do this, some languages \"encode\" this information onto the noun itself: \"The cat-n chased the mouse-a\", for example. Overall, noun cases help us understand how different words relate to each other in a sentence. Here are several common noun cases: Case Example Function Nominative I am The subject of the sentence Accusative He hit me The direct object of the verb Dative She gave me the book The indirect object of the verb Genitive The car's engine runs Shows possession or a relationship between nouns Ablative He walked from the park Shows movement away from a place or time Vocative Alex , come here Used to address or call out to someone directly Locative She's in New York Shows location or where something is happening or located However, besides the first four noun cases, most other cases don't have a direct translation into English, so it is often straightforward to see the different types of cases (because they will often be translated literally). The best tip for these sorts of problems is to look for repetition . Look at common phrases in the English translation, usually corresponding to common noun cases, and try and see how they compare in the target language's translation. Try the problem below. Don't forget about phonology! Key Problem: Noun Cases UKLO 2023/1/5. Permyak Verbs: Person, Tense, Aspect, and Mood While nouns typically have a limited number of cases they can decline to, verbs are much more complex in terms of the information they encode. One of the primary ways in which verbs vary across languages is through verb conjugation and affixation, which involves the modification of the verb form and addition of several suffixes and prefixes to indicate different aspects of person, tense, aspect, and mood. Different languages use different strategies for conveying this information, and some languages have many more verb forms than others. In some languages, the endings of verbs change depending on the gender of the subject or object, while in others the verb form remains the same regardless of gender. It's often a toss-up to what exactly a problem involving verbs will test, but here are a few things to look out for. Person Languages encode information about person onto their verbs in various ways, including through the use of different verb forms, affixes, or other means of modification. Below are some examples of how different languages encode information about person and other related features: Most languages distinguish between different persons, including the first person (referring to the speaker), the second person (referring to the listener), and the third person (referring to someone or something else). Some languages even have a person hierarchy , meaning that they have an \"ordering\" of persons, and if a person lower on the hiearchy is the subject and a person higher on the hierarchy is the object, then an additional marker is applied to the verb. Languages can also distinguish between animate and inanimate objects or beings. For example, some languages use a different verb form when the subject is animate versus inanimate. Additionally, some languages distinguish between humans and non-human animate beings. Just like person hierarchy, animacy hierarchy exists. Some languages, such as Spanish and French, use different verb forms to indicate gender. In some cases, the verb form changes based on the gender of the subject or object. For example, in Spanish, the verb \"to love\" has different forms for \"I love\" (yo amo) and \"she loves\" (ella ama). Languages also have different ways of encoding plural information onto verbs. For example, some languages have separate verb forms for singular and plural subjects or objects. Additionally, some languages have specific verb forms for addressing multiple people, such as the English \"you all\" or \"y'all\" for the plural \"you\". Some languages use different verb forms to indicate politeness or formality. For example, in Korean, the polite verb form includes an honorific suffix. Similarly, in Japanese, the polite verb form often includes a special verb ending and different verb stems. Many of these are not overtly marked in English, so it's important to pay attention to them if they do come up. Tense Tense is the grammatical category that refers to the time of an event or action in relation to the moment of speaking. The most common tenses are past, present, and future. Some languages also have additional tenses, such as the perfect tense, which indicates that an action was completed in the past with ongoing effects in the present. You probably know the past, present, and future, but some languages have more distinctions of the past (say, a few days ago, a few minutes ago, and a very long time ago) or the future, which might not be apparent from the English translations. Aspect Aspect is the grammatical category that describes how an event or action unfolds over time. The most common aspects are perfective (indicating a completed action) and imperfective (indicating an ongoing or incomplete action). Other aspects include habitual (referring to a repeated action) and progressive (referring to an action in progress). These are often not marked directly on the verb in English, but they can be in other languages. Mood Mood is the grammatical category that expresses the speaker's attitude or perspective toward an event or action. The most common moods are indicative (stating a fact or expressing a belief), subjunctive (expressing a hypothetical or counterfactual situation), and imperative (giving a command or making a request). These don't appear very often in linguistics olympiads, but it's useful to know them just in case you need to know what a language might do. Other Things There's more that verbs can do! For example, you might have been told to \"avoid the passive voice\". Passive voice is a grammatical construction that changes the focus of a sentence from the subject performing an action to the object receiving the action. In passive voice, the subject of the sentence is acted upon rather than acting. For example, \"The ball was thrown by John\" is in passive voice, while \"John threw the ball\" is in active voice. Some languages mark the verb for passive voice, however, as opposed to changing word order. Another distinction is called active-stative . Active and stative verbs are two categories of verbs that describe different types of actions or states. Active verbs describe actions that are performed by the subject of the sentence. For example, \"I am running\" or \"She is singing.\" These verbs typically indicate a dynamic, ongoing activity and can often take an object that receives the action. On the other hand, stative verbs describe a state or condition that is attributed to the subject. For example, \"I am happy\" or \"She knows the answer.\" These verbs typically describe a static, unchanging state or characteristic, and cannot be used with an object in the same way that active verbs can. Some languages will deal with these verbs differently as well. Practice Verb Problem Key Problem: Verb Morphology Intro UKLO 2023/1/2. Jam Sai We'll just present a walkthrough here, and ask you to fill in the details. This problem borders on phonology also, but it just serves as an example to get you started in these sorts of problems. Look at each row. How is the left word changed to get to the right word? (Note: this change might not be the same for all of them!) Consider the two types of \"changes\" happening to the verbs. Categorize the verbs into these two types, and observe any patterns. (Some of these changes have their own distinct English verb, but some don't.) Where is the change inserted? What is the change inserted? Separate the verbs with nasalization ( n ) from those without. Which words have nasalization? (Hint: what are the nasals?) Conclude the problem. The above problem was relatively straightforward in terms of morphology, but some morphologies can be much more complicated. Here's another one for you to try that has a slightly strange system (but shows you the breadth of things human language can encode onto verbs!)

The parallel text serves as a key to unlock the meaning of the unknown language. The name \"Rosetta Stone\" comes from the famous ancient Egyptian artifact that was inscribed with a decree in three different scripts: hieroglyphics, Demotic script, and Ancient Greek. The discovery of the Rosetta Stone allowed scholars to decipher ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics by comparing them to the known Greek text. Rosettas are the bread and butter of linguistics olympiads; you can almost guarantee that you will see at least one on any olympiad you do. Despite this, they can often be very challenging, mainly because they can focus on so many aspects at once that you need to be careful to dissect. Often times, parts of phonology creep into these problems too, so you have to watch out for that!","title":"Introduction to Rosettas"},{"location":"morphology-rosetta/#morphology","text":"Morphology is like building with blocks to make words. Just like how you can make different things with Lego blocks, you can make different words by combining smaller parts called \"morphemes.\" Morphemes are like the Lego blocks - they're the building blocks of words. By putting different morphemes together, you can create different words and change their meaning. For example, the word \"unhappiness\" is made up of three morphemes: \"un-\", \"happy\", and \"-ness.\" The \"un-\" means not, \"happy\" means feeling good, and \"-ness\" means a state of. So when you put them all together, you get the word \"unhappiness\" which means not feeling good. In morphology Rosetta problems, you are given several words or phrases (but often not full sentences) in a target language and English, and you need to determine the rules for coming up with similar phrases.","title":"Morphology"},{"location":"morphology-rosetta/#noun-cases","text":"Source Resource Description Artifexian Nouns: A Case of Case A dive into several aspects of noun cases. (You definitely don't need to know everything discussed in this video!) When we talk about things, we sometimes need to use different words or word endings to show how they relate to the other words in a sentence. This is where noun cases come in. For example, let's say we have the sentence \"The cat chased the mouse.\" In this sentence, \"cat\" is the subject - it's doing the chasing - so we use the \"nominative\" case for the word \"cat.\" But if we change the sentence to \"The mouse was chased by the cat,\" now \"mouse\" is the subject and \"cat\" is the one doing the chasing. So now we use the \"nominative\" case for \"mouse\" and the \"accusative\" case for \"cat.\" To do this, some languages \"encode\" this information onto the noun itself: \"The cat-n chased the mouse-a\", for example. Overall, noun cases help us understand how different words relate to each other in a sentence. Here are several common noun cases: Case Example Function Nominative I am The subject of the sentence Accusative He hit me The direct object of the verb Dative She gave me the book The indirect object of the verb Genitive The car's engine runs Shows possession or a relationship between nouns Ablative He walked from the park Shows movement away from a place or time Vocative Alex , come here Used to address or call out to someone directly Locative She's in New York Shows location or where something is happening or located However, besides the first four noun cases, most other cases don't have a direct translation into English, so it is often straightforward to see the different types of cases (because they will often be translated literally). The best tip for these sorts of problems is to look for repetition . Look at common phrases in the English translation, usually corresponding to common noun cases, and try and see how they compare in the target language's translation. Try the problem below.

Permyak","title":"Noun Cases"},{"location":"morphology-rosetta/#verbs-person-tense-aspect-and-mood","text":"While nouns typically have a limited number of cases they can decline to, verbs are much more complex in terms of the information they encode. One of the primary ways in which verbs vary across languages is through verb conjugation and affixation, which involves the modification of the verb form and addition of several suffixes and prefixes to indicate different aspects of person, tense, aspect, and mood. Different languages use different strategies for conveying this information, and some languages have many more verb forms than others. In some languages, the endings of verbs change depending on the gender of the subject or object, while in others the verb form remains the same regardless of gender. It's often a toss-up to what exactly a problem involving verbs will test, but here are a few things to look out for.","title":"Verbs: Person, Tense, Aspect, and Mood"},{"location":"morphology-rosetta/#person","text":"Languages encode information about person onto their verbs in various ways, including through the use of different verb forms, affixes, or other means of modification. Below are some examples of how different languages encode information about person and other related features: Most languages distinguish between different persons, including the first person (referring to the speaker), the second person (referring to the listener), and the third person (referring to someone or something else). Some languages even have a person hierarchy , meaning that they have an \"ordering\" of persons, and if a person lower on the hiearchy is the subject and a person higher on the hierarchy is the object, then an additional marker is applied to the verb. Languages can also distinguish between animate and inanimate objects or beings. For example, some languages use a different verb form when the subject is animate versus inanimate. Additionally, some languages distinguish between humans and non-human animate beings. Just like person hierarchy, animacy hierarchy exists. Some languages, such as Spanish and French, use different verb forms to indicate gender. In some cases, the verb form changes based on the gender of the subject or object. For example, in Spanish, the verb \"to love\" has different forms for \"I love\" (yo amo) and \"she loves\" (ella ama). Languages also have different ways of encoding plural information onto verbs. For example, some languages have separate verb forms for singular and plural subjects or objects. Additionally, some languages have specific verb forms for addressing multiple people, such as the English \"you all\" or \"y'all\" for the plural \"you\". Some languages use different verb forms to indicate politeness or formality. For example, in Korean, the polite verb form includes an honorific suffix. Similarly, in Japanese, the polite verb form often includes a special verb ending and different verb stems. Many of these are not overtly marked in English, so it's important to pay attention to them if they do come up.","title":"Person"},{"location":"morphology-rosetta/#tense","text":"Tense is the grammatical category that refers to the time of an event or action in relation to the moment of speaking. The most common tenses are past, present, and future. Some languages also have additional tenses, such as the perfect tense, which indicates that an action was completed in the past with ongoing effects in the present. You probably know the past, present, and future, but some languages have more distinctions of the past (say, a few days ago, a few minutes ago, and a very long time ago) or the future, which might not be apparent from the English translations.","title":"Tense"},{"location":"morphology-rosetta/#aspect","text":"Aspect is the grammatical category that describes how an event or action unfolds over time. The most common aspects are perfective (indicating a completed action) and imperfective (indicating an ongoing or incomplete action). Other aspects include habitual (referring to a repeated action) and progressive (referring to an action in progress). These are often not marked directly on the verb in English, but they can be in other languages.","title":"Aspect"},{"location":"morphology-rosetta/#mood","text":"Mood is the grammatical category that expresses the speaker's attitude or perspective toward an event or action. The most common moods are indicative (stating a fact or expressing a belief), subjunctive (expressing a hypothetical or counterfactual situation), and imperative (giving a command or making a request). These don't appear very often in linguistics olympiads, but it's useful to know them just in case you need to know what a language might do.","title":"Mood"},{"location":"morphology-rosetta/#other-things","text":"There's more that verbs can do! For example, you might have been told to \"avoid the passive voice\". Passive voice is a grammatical construction that changes the focus of a sentence from the subject performing an action to the object receiving the action. In passive voice, the subject of the sentence is acted upon rather than acting. For example, \"The ball was thrown by John\" is in passive voice, while \"John threw the ball\" is in active voice. Some languages mark the verb for passive voice, however, as opposed to changing word order. Another distinction is called active-stative . Active and stative verbs are two categories of verbs that describe different types of actions or states. Active verbs describe actions that are performed by the subject of the sentence. For example, \"I am running\" or \"She is singing.\" These verbs typically indicate a dynamic, ongoing activity and can often take an object that receives the action. On the other hand, stative verbs describe a state or condition that is attributed to the subject. For example, \"I am happy\" or \"She knows the answer.\" These verbs typically describe a static, unchanging state or characteristic, and cannot be used with an object in the same way that active verbs can. Some languages will deal with these verbs differently as well.","title":"Other Things"},{"location":"morphology-rosetta/#practice-verb-problem","text":"Key Problem: Verb Morphology Intro UKLO 2023/1/2.

IPA Chart IPA Chart An interactive IPA chart to hear how all the sounds are pronounced. The International Phonetic Alphabet , or IPA for short, is a system of phonetic notation that uses symbols to represent the sounds of human speech. It was first developed in the late 19th century and has since been revised several times. The key thing you need to know about the IPA is that you don't need to memorize it! But it does help to know some of the common patterns that you might see, which can help you with future problems. The IPA includes symbols for all the consonants, vowels, and diphthongs that occur in the world's languages. The symbols are based on the sounds themselves, rather than on the way they are spelled in a particular language. For example, the sound represented by the English letter \"y\" in \"yay!\" is represented in the IPA by the symbol /j/. The idea of learning about the IPA is not to get you to know every symbol (they will be explained in problem statements anyway), but look at the relationships between these symbols. The IPA is structured in such a way that it is easy to describe sound changes as certain movements in the table. Agreement Key Problem: Sound Changes NACLO 2019/A. Malteaser How do we approach this problem? Note that there are four types of beginning words: il l li iC , where C is the first consonant of the following word. When are each of these words used? We can make a table: Type 1 il Type 2 l Type 3 li Type 4 iC qassis g\u0127onq m\u0127adda s\u0127ana mara art ksie\u0127 \u010bpar \u0121obon uffi\u010b\u010bju \u0127mar dar bar jum bdeiwa \u017cir ktieb ra\u0121el vjola sil\u0121 Note that there are two words, il lvant and il lan\u0121as , which we are not sure if they should go in type 1 or type 4. However, looking at the words we already have, we can make some observations. Noticing that words of type 4 have a clear starting point as to what we should look for (they match the first consonant of the word), let's look at these first letters: s, \u010b, d, \u017c, r. If we imagine shading in the cells containing these letters in the pronunciation table given, we can clearly see that they are all alveolar consonants. Looking at the other three types of words, none of them begin with an alveolar, except for \u0121obon . Therefore, since this pattern is supported by essentially all of the given words except one, we can conclude that \u0121obon is one of the words mentioned in task A1 that doesn't follow the normal rules of Maltese, and we expect to see i\u0121 \u0121obon . This also means il lvant and il lan\u0121as will be type 4, so let's update our table. Type 1 il Type 2 l Type 3 li Type 4 iC qassis g\u0127onq m\u0127adda s\u0127ana mara art ksie\u0127 \u010bpar bar uffi\u010b\u010bju \u0127mar dar ktieb jum bdeiwa \u017cir vjola ra\u0121el sil\u0121 \u0121obon (breaks rules) lvant lan\u0121as There isn't a similar \"type of consonant\" distinction in any of the remaining three types, so let's look at other information the problem gives us. We are also told that h and g\u0127 are silent, and there is only a single word starting with either of them: g\u0127onq , in type 2. If we remove it, we notice that all of these words start with a vowel or semivowel j , while none of the other ones do, so we conclude that type 2 words are those that begin with a vowel or semivowel. We're almost done now: the only thing left to distinguish is types 1 and 3. We also know that exactly one of these words breaks the rules. Looking at type 3, we can see that all words begin with two consonants, while it looks like two words from type 1 do. However, recalling that j acts more like a vowel than a consonant from our type 2 analysis, we conclude that type 3 words are formed through initial consonant clusters (two consonants at the beginning of a word), where j is not considered as a consonant, and ktieb is the other incorrect word, for which we expect li ktieb . Whew! Finally, we're done. Common Sound Changes Sound changes are the alterations that occur in the pronunciation of a language over time. These changes can affect individual sounds or entire groups of sounds. Here are some of the most common types of sound changes in linguistics: Voicing: This type of sound change involves the voicing of consonants, where a voiceless consonant becomes voiced, or vice versa. For example, in English, the word \"life\" used to be pronounced with a voiceless \"f\" sound, but it has evolved to have a voiced \"v\" sound in modern English. Palatalization: Palatalization refers to the change of a consonant sound to a palatal sound, which is made by bringing the tongue closer to the hard palate. In Slavic languages, for example, the sound \"k\" can palatalize to \"\u010d\" in certain contexts. Vowel Harmony: Vowel harmony occurs when the pronunciation of one vowel sound is influenced by the presence of another vowel sound in a word. This is common in many Turkic and Uralic languages. For example, in Turkish, all vowels in a word must agree in terms of frontness or backness (based on the IPA vowel trapezoid). Lenition: Lenition refers to the weakening or softening of consonant sounds over time. This can happen in many languages, such as in the Romance languages where Latin \"p\" and \"b\" evolved into fricatives like \"f\" and \"v\" respectively. Assimilation: Assimilation occurs when a sound is influenced by a neighboring sound and becomes more similar to it. For example, in English, the \"n\" in the word \"in\" is pronounced differently depending on the following sound. In \"in the\", it becomes \"n\" as usual, but in \"in this\", it becomes \"\u014b\", assimilating to the following \"th\" sound. Metathesis: Metathesis is a phenomenon where two sounds switch positions within a word. For example, in English, the word \"ask\" used to be pronounced as \"aks\" in Old English. These are just a few examples of the many types of sound changes that can occur in a language over time, but they are the most common changes that can occur.

The top 10% of students on this round advance to the Invitational Round . Based on recent contests, this round usually has 8 or 9 problems. Traditionally, the contest has problems worth 5, 10, 15, or 20 points, for a total of 100. Recently, however, problems with 20 points have not appeared as much, and most of the problems are either 15 or 10 points. Starting the Contest Unlike many other contests, the problems in the NACLO are not arranged in order of difficulty . This means that it's often a good idea to spend a few minutes at the start looking through the problems and deciding which ones are most approachable for you. Often times, by practicing different categories of problems, you will find that some come more naturally than others, so what's often a good idea is to make a small table at the beginning of each contest and crossing them off one by one. In addition, look at the point distribution ! It is often the case that although the NACLO jury tries their best to match point distribution to difficulty, this difficulty is very hard to predict (and varies wildly from person to person), so you shouldn't take it as how hard the problem will be for you . Time Management Managing your time is crucial in the NACLO. With only 3 hours to solve 8-9 problems, it's important to allocate your time wisely. One common strategy is to spend the first 5-10 minutes reading and understanding the problems, then choosing the easiest ones to solve. As you work through the problems, keep an eye on the clock and make sure you're making steady progress. It's always okay to skip problems and come back to them later! In fact, by skipping a problem, you can let it simmer in the back of your head while you approach other problems, and perhaps by the time you come back you might have another idea on how to solve it. Partial Credit The Open Round does not feature fully explained \"solutions\", only specific answers. However, there is still often partial credit for some answers that are close to the correct answer (for example, swapping two words in a sentence or omitting a certain word), so it is often recommended to write something down for every problem on the contest, just to maximize your chances of partials.","title":"Approaching the Open Round"},{"location":"round-1/#approaching-the-open-round","text":"","title":"Approaching the Open Round"},{"location":"round-1/#listed-round-format","text":"The first round of the contest, the Open Round, usually contains 6-9 problems and is 3 hours long.

Recently, however, problems with 20 points have not appeared as much, and most of the problems are either 15 or 10 points.","title":"Listed Round Format"},{"location":"round-1/#starting-the-contest","text":"Unlike many other contests, the problems in the NACLO are not arranged in order of difficulty . This means that it's often a good idea to spend a few minutes at the start looking through the problems and deciding which ones are most approachable for you. Often times, by practicing different categories of problems, you will find that some come more naturally than others, so what's often a good idea is to make a small table at the beginning of each contest and crossing them off one by one. In addition, look at the point distribution ! It is often the case that although the NACLO jury tries their best to match point distribution to difficulty, this difficulty is very hard to predict (and varies wildly from person to person), so you shouldn't take it as how hard the problem will be for you .","title":"Starting the Contest"},{"location":"round-1/#time-management","text":"Managing your time is crucial in the NACLO. With only 3 hours to solve 8-9 problems, it's important to allocate your time wisely. One common strategy is to spend the first 5-10 minutes reading and understanding the problems, then choosing the easiest ones to solve. As you work through the problems, keep an eye on the clock and make sure you're making steady progress. It's always okay to skip problems and come back to them later! In fact, by skipping a problem, you can let it simmer in the back of your head while you approach other problems, and perhaps by the time you come back you might have another idea on how to solve it.","title":"Time Management"},{"location":"round-1/#partial-credit","text":"The Open Round does not feature fully explained \"solutions\", only specific answers.

Based on recent contests, however, this round usually has 8 or 9 problems. Similarly to the open round, traditionally, the contest has problems worth 5, 10, 15, or 20 points, for a total of 100. Recently, however, problems with 20 points have not appeared as much, and most of the problems are either 15 or 10 points. All the points from the Open Round apply here too, but there is one additional difference. Writing Explanations The major difference between Open Round and the Invitational Round is that the latter features explanations . This means that for some problems, you need to not only answer the questions presented but also explain your observations. Often times, this is phrased in the form \"describe your observations of X\". Often times, these explanations are worth a significant portion of the problem's score, and it is the best way to get partial credit: even if you can't do the tasks the problem gives you, writing out a solution can show the grader how much partial progress you've made. When writing explanations, it is important to remember that you should not describe the entire logical process of how you arrived at the answer. Instead, focus on writing down your observations. This means that you should provide a brief summary of the key features or patterns that you noticed in the data presented. In general, you do not need to provide a full dictionary of every word and its translation, unless the problem specifically asks you to do so, with one exception: if the problem is about numbers, it is reasonable to expect you to make a table of all the number words (that you can find out) and their translations. You can use common acronyms (S (subject), O (object), etc.) to make your explanations more concise; however, try to avoid using formal linguistic terminology unless it is necessary to explain your observations. Instead, focus on explaining what you mean in simple, straightforward language. Tables can be very helpful in organizing your observations, and you should use them whenever possible. There will be more specific instructions in later sections on how to write up each type of problem, but in general, it is easier to digest tables of information rather than one long paragraph. Keep in mind that your solution can also be awarded points for style, in addition to its content. Even if you have a completely correct solution, the way it is presented can often give it a slightly higher score and make it easier for the grader to understand. Finally, it is worth noting that there are Best Solutions awards for several problems, which can be awarded to multiple people. So even if you don't get the highest score on a problem, if you have a particularly elegant or insightful solution, you may still be recognized for your work.","title":"Approaching the Invitational Round"},{"location":"round-2/#approaching-the-invitational-round","text":"","title":"Approaching the Invitational Round"},{"location":"round-2/#listed-round-format","text":"The second round of the contest, the Invitational Round, usually contains 8-12 (usually harder) problems and is 4 hours long.

What's Changed Sentence Rosettas take everything in morphology rosettas and cranks it up to 11, by combining nouns and verbs along with some entirely new aspects, which we'll touch on below. These are the true challenges of sentence translation, and you can guarantee that at least one of the Rosettas you'll see will be involving full sentences. Often times, there will be one key aspect that the problem will focus on, which we'll touch on below, but you will still need to do a lot of initial \"legwork\" to help you figure out the basic nouns and verbs, and only then will you get to the more intricate topics described below (or perhaps, more complicated morphology that just one verb alone can't display). Word Order Source Resource Description Artifexian [WORD ORDER This Video Enjoyed You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFe1ahJ_LTk) Word order refers to the arrangement of words in a sentence. It is a fundamental aspect of language that allows speakers to convey meaning effectively. In English, word order generally follows a subject-verb-object (SVO) pattern, where the subject comes first, followed by the verb, and then the object. For example, \"I ate an apple.\" However, not all languages follow this pattern. Some languages have a subject-object-verb (SOV) pattern, where the subject comes first, followed by the object, and then the verb. For example, in Japanese, \"I ate an apple\" would be \"Watashi wa ringo wo tabemashita.\" There are also languages with a verb-subject-object (VSO) pattern, where the verb comes first, followed by the subject, and then the object. For example, in Irish, \"I ate an apple\" would be \"D'ith m\u00e9 \u00fall.\" Similarly, adjectives often attach onto nouns, but they might not always go before the noun: \"pink bear\" in English might literally be \"bear pink\" in another language. Let's do a walkthrough: Key Problem: Beginning Sentence Rosettas NACLO 2021/A. The Tortoise and The Rabbit What is the word order for sentences, and for adjectives? Keep a table of the vocabulary you have, and complete task A1 . How does past tense work? How do the determiners (the, this, that) function? (They don't need to just be one word!) Expand your vocabulary table, and complete task A2 . You can check your answers here . Some languages have free word order, which means that the order of words in a sentence is not fixed and can vary depending on the context or emphasis. For example, in Latin, the subject, object, and verb can be arranged in any order because the function of each word is indicated by its case. This allows for more flexibility in word order because the function of each noun is indicated by its case, rather than its position in the sentence, like mentioned in the previous section. And this idea of free word order leads to the next commonly seen topic... Focus Focus in linguistics refers to the part of a sentence or discourse that receives special emphasis or attention. It can be thought of as the main point or idea that the speaker or writer is trying to convey. For example, in the sentence \"John ate an apple,\" the focus is on the fact that John performed the action of eating, rather than on the apple itself. One interesting feature of focus is that it can be marked in a variety of ways in different languages. For instance, some languages use word order to indicate focus, allowing for free word order within a sentence. In these languages, the focused element can appear anywhere in the sentence, as long as it is accompanied by a special marker that indicates its importance. For example, in some languages with noun cases, in the sentence \"I saw a cat,\" if the focus is on the cat, the sentence would be structured as \"Cat I saw\" (with all words marked for case). Independent and Dependent Clauses When we talk about clauses in grammar, we are referring to groups of words that contain a subject and a predicate, which means they can express a complete thought or idea. There are two main types of clauses: dependent and independent clauses. An independent clause is a group of words that can stand alone as a sentence, expressing a complete thought. For example, \"I like to read books.\" This sentence contains an independent clause because it expresses a complete idea, and it can stand alone as a complete sentence. On the other hand, a dependent clause is a group of words that cannot stand alone as a sentence, and it relies on an independent clause to complete its meaning. For example, \"Because I like to read books.\" This sentence contains a dependent clause because it cannot stand alone as a sentence, and it relies on the independent clause \"I like to read books\" to complete its meaning. Conjunctions are words that join clauses, phrases, or words together. They are used to show the relationship between the parts of a sentence. For example, \"I like to read books, and my sister likes to watch movies.\" In this sentence, the conjunction \"and\" is used to join two independent clauses together. Sometimes, languages can deal with clauses in unique ways, so it's important to carefully translate each word and see where the matches are. The locations of clauses in the sentences can also be unexpected. Transitivity In linguistics, verbs can be classified based on the number of arguments they take. Specifically, verbs can be classified as intransitive, transitive, or ditransitive. Intransitive verbs: These are verbs that do not require an object to complete their meaning. They only need a subject to form a complete sentence. For example: She slept. The cat jumped. He ran. In these examples, the verbs slept, jumped, and ran do not require an object to complete their meaning. They are therefore intransitive verbs. Transitive verbs: These are verbs that require an object to complete their meaning. They have a subject, a verb, and an object. For example: She ate an apple. The dog chased the cat. He read a book. In these examples, the verbs ate, chased, and read require an object to complete their meaning. They are therefore transitive verbs. Ditransitive verbs: These are verbs that take two objects: a direct object and an indirect object. The indirect object usually comes before the direct object. For example: She gave him a present. They sent us a postcard. He told her a story. In these examples, the verbs gave, sent, and told take both a direct and indirect object. The indirect object is the recipient of the direct object. They are therefore ditransitive verbs. Sometimes, these verbs are treated differently, Ergativity Source Resource Description Artifexian Ergativity: Her Likes She A deep dive into ergativity. Consider these two sentences. She chased her. She slept. Notice that the subject \"she\" in the first sentence is the one doing the action of chasing, while in the second sentence, \"she\" is the one being acted upon by sleep. In linguistic terms, the first sentence is transitive, meaning it has a direct object, while the second sentence is intransitive, meaning it does not have a direct object. Now, let's look at how ergativity comes into play in these sentences. In ergative languages, the subject of an intransitive verb is treated differently from the subject of a transitive verb. Specifically, the subject of an intransitive verb is treated like the object of a transitive verb, while the subject of a transitive verb is treated differently. There are names for these three types of words: A is used for the a gent of a transitive verb (the one who is doing the action), O for the o bject of a transitive verb (the one who recieves the action), and S for the s ubject of an intransitive verb. In nominative-accusative alignment, A = S (the nominative case) and O is the accusative case. Let's take a different hypothetical ergative language: She chased her. Her slept. In this hypothetical language, the word order for the first sentence might be \"She her chased\", with \"her\" marked as the direct object of the verb \"chased\". However, in the second sentence, the word order might be \"She slept\", with \"she\" marked as the object of the verb \"slept\". So, in this language, the subject of the intransitive verb \"slept\" is marked the same way as the object of the transitive verb \"chased\". In ergative-absolutive environment, O = S (the absolutive case) and A is the ergative case. Of course, this is not the only way to deal with these pronouns, but this distinction is common enough to appear in several problems. And More! There's even more information that's seen here, like converbs, wh- versus polar question formation, and how adjectives work! Most of these are fairly ad-hoc, though; the most important thing to remember for all of them is that the rule should be consistent throughout. Do I Have To Know All Of This? Short answer: no. Long answer: it might be helpful when these phenomena are not evident from the English translation (for example, ergativity), but you would still be able to figure it out from the data. And remember, you don't need to use any fancy linguistic terminology! Try and stick to more commonly accepted descriptions, and show with examples. You might have also noticed that we haven't sprinkled key problems throughout, because a large part of these problems is figuring out what exactly is the feature that's being focused on.

This guide does not serve as a syllabus! It features topics from prior NACLO problems and does not necessarily predict future ones. The NACLO may present problems involving topics not discussed. Due to the lack of widely-available NACLO resources, this guide aims to be a place where beginners can learn about the contest and contestants can hone their skills on the various topics the NACLO covers. Throughout this guide, we will cover various topics that are tested in NACLO, such as morphology, syntax, semantics, and computational problems. We will also provide helpful tips and strategies for approaching NACLO problems and suggest additional resources for further study. So, whether you are a high school student interested in competing in NACLO, a teacher looking to incorporate computational linguistics into your curriculum, or simply someone interested in the fascinating world of language technology, we hope you find this guide informative and useful. How to Use This Many sections contain problems which you should solve. Some of these problems are marked with an exclamation mark (!), and we strongly recommend you try them out. The sections are essentially independent, so you can proceed them in any order you wish. However, it is recommended that you start with the sections that introduce the basics of the contest before moving on to more advanced topics. In addition to the problems included in this guide, we also recommend that you practice with additional past NACLO problems . The Types of Problems There are three general \"categories\" of problems which this guide is divided into. Common problems are the types of problems that you would expect \"most\" problems to be; there are usally 2-4 of each type across both rounds. Likely problems are the unique types of problems that usually appear in each contest, but not multiple times; there are usually 1 of each type across both rounds.

We will also provide helpful tips and strategies for approaching NACLO problems and suggest additional resources for further study. So, whether you are a high school student interested in competing in NACLO, a teacher looking to incorporate computational linguistics into your curriculum, or simply someone interested in the fascinating world of language technology, we hope you find this guide informative and useful.","title":"About This Project"},{"location":"using-this-guide/#how-to-use-this","text":"Many sections contain problems which you should solve. Some of these problems are marked with an exclamation mark (!), and we strongly recommend you try them out. The sections are essentially independent, so you can proceed them in any order you wish. However, it is recommended that you start with the sections that introduce the basics of the contest before moving on to more advanced topics. In addition to the problems included in this guide, we also recommend that you practice with additional past NACLO problems .","title":"How to Use This"},{"location":"using-this-guide/#the-types-of-problems","text":"There are three general \"categories\" of problems which this guide is divided into. Common problems are the types of problems that you would expect \"most\" problems to be; there are usally 2-4 of each type across both rounds. Likely problems are the unique types of problems that usually appear in each contest, but not multiple times; there are usually 1 of each type across both rounds. Rare problems have only historically appeared a few times, and perhaps never in recent contests.","title":"The Types of Problems"},{"location":"what-is-naclo/","text":"What is NACLO? An example In sum, NACLO is boiling problem-solving and logical reasoning to its purest form, using language as a medium. NACLO is infamously hard to explain in words, so it's best to give an example. Consider the following table of Turkish and English sentences. Can you fill in the blanks? Turkish English Z\u00fcrafa ko\u015ftu. The giraffe ran. Bal\u0131k y\u00fczd\u00fc. The fish swam. Z\u00fcrafa atlad\u0131. The giraffe jumped. Fil ko\u015ftu. The elephant ran. ? The fish jumped. Fil y\u00fczd\u00fc. ? Adapted from NACLO 2022/B, by Tom McCoy These are linguistics problems: using deductive reasoning to infer patterns in languages. Now that you've seen an example, let's delve a bit deeper into what NACLO is all about. General information NACLO stands for the North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad. It is a contest designed to challenge the problem-solving and analytical skills of high school students in the fields of linguistics and computational thinking. Participants don't need prior knowledge of linguistics or any specific languages, as the contest focuses on pattern recognition and logical reasoning. The competition consists of two rounds: an open round and an invitational round. The open round is available to all interested high school students in the United States and Canada, and the top-scoring students are invited to participate in the invitational round. The best performers in the invitational round can then represent North America in the International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL), where they compete against teams from around the world. In NACLO, participants are given a set of problems that involve different languages and scripts. These problems require the use of logical deduction, pattern recognition, and creative thinking to solve puzzles related to language structure, meaning, or translation. In some cases, as in the example above, participants might be asked to decipher the grammar and vocabulary of an unfamiliar language, while in others, they might need to solve a linguistic mystery or analyze a language's properties. To participate in NACLO, students don't need any specific background or expertise in linguistics, as the problems are designed to be accessible to anyone with a strong sense of curiosity and a knack for problem-solving. If you enjoy puzzles, brain teasers, or simply exploring the intricacies of language, NACLO might be a great fit for you! Keep looking around for more practice problems.","title":"What is NACLO?"},{"location":"what-is-naclo/#what-is-naclo","text":"","title":"What is NACLO?"},{"location":"what-is-naclo/#an-example","text":"In sum, NACLO is boiling problem-solving and logical reasoning to its purest form, using language as a medium.

There are a few common misconceptions of linguistics olympiads and how to train for them: NACLO is all about memorizing languages. Although some problems you practice might be more well-known languages (like the Turkish example ), harder problems often feature very obscure languages with fewer than 10,000 speakers (and many feature extinct languages with no speakers left!). Rest assured, most people, if not all, are solving problems with languages that are foreign to them. There are over 7000 living languages in the world, and many more that are extinct, so we won't be running out of linguistics problems and obscure languages any time soon! NACLO is about knowing a bunch of formal linguistics. Unlike many other science olympiads, NACLO is unique in that it requires no prior knowledge in linguistics, and all problems are designed so that anyone would be able to solve them, regardless of how much training they have. That said, this guide will be using formal linguistics terms only because we need a name to refer to (and also in case you want to explore them more on your free time!), but you don't have to go out of your way to remember every noun case. In fact, trying to remember linguistics terminology is often discouraged , because the grader might not know the formal terminology, and if you misremember then you can lose points even if your solution is correct. Just remember the key rule: all problems are designed to be solved without any prior knowledge! NACLO is just for linguistics majors or language enthusiasts. While it's true that linguistics majors and language enthusiasts might have an advantage in some areas, the competition is open to anyone in middle or high school who is interested in solving puzzles and exploring new languages. In fact, many past NACLO winners have come from backgrounds completely unrelated to linguistics, such as mathematics or computer science. NACLO is a great opportunity to challenge yourself and learn something new, regardless of your background, and you might even discover a new passion for linguistics or language learning along the way!","title":"What isn\u2019t NACLO?"},{"location":"what-isnt-naclo/#what-isnt-naclo","text":"There are a few common misconceptions of linguistics olympiads and how to train for them: NACLO is all about memorizing languages.
